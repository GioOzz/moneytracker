## Money Tracker

Chat-GPT said:
To create a money tracker app on Windows and iOS, I recommend using the following technologies:

#### Technologies
Xamarin: is an open-source framework that allows you to create native apps for Windows and iOS using C# and the .NET framework. 
This means you can use the same code for both platforms, which saves you time and effort.

Firebase: Firebase offers a wide range of services for app development, including real-time database, user authentication, and analytics. 
In this case you could use the real-time database to store transaction data and authentication to manage users.

#### Architecture

Regarding architecture, I recommend using a layered architecture, such as MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel), 
which allows you to separate the business logic from the user interface and network calls. 
This allows you to keep your code more organized and easier to maintain.

Also, you might consider using a navigation library such as Prism or MVVMCross to manage navigation between app pages and share code across platforms.

In general, it is important to keep in mind that the choice of technologies and architecture 
will depend on the specific needs of your project, so I recommend that you carefully consider your options and do your research before deciding.
